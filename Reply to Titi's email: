R1. Workflow orchestration with data locality aware scheduling
R2. Data flow solution to expose data locality details about the data
R3. Horizontally scalable solution
R4. Solution adapted to working on heterogenous, low resources, geo-distributed hardware
R5. Thorough analysis of the performance and scalability implications of major design / implementation choices
R6. Ability to orchestrate across different techs (compute steps and data flow solutions)
R7. Batch and stream processing semantics
R8. Provide an example workflow to showcase the functionalities.


Validation/Measurements (in the context of the proposed solution)

M1. Data locality effect
M2. Comparison of serialization solutions: JSON vs Protobuf
M3. Comparison of transport choices (GRPC vs REST)
M4. Shared containers across chunks vs one container per data item to be processed
M6. Containerized microservices vs monoliths - this might take some time to implement with little benefit, 
M7. scalability test - probably not feasible


Of course, not all might get included in the final version of the thesis but I do believe that a significant chunk of the the thesis content will come from analyzing R1, R2 and R5. 

Value in calling out what are the gaps in the current evaluation when it comes to requirements that harder to evaluate like: R3 and R4. Of course, small local experiments can be performed for those. R6 is also quite challenging to get completeness on so it will just brush upon it. 

 required to support the experiments. I have a pretty clear focus on the runtime performance of the framework, and a significant chunk of my contributions would be R3. the evaluation of major design / implementation decisions - while these are not clear at this moment, I'm sure I'll be able to run a few localized experiments to get some numbers on aspects such as shared containers, different serialization solution, optimizing the data flow proposed solution etc.
