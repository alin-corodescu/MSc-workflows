Go through the experiments and think which ones are actually worth it. 
    Highlight what piece of work is required for each experiment.
    Prioritize them and prioritize the work through that.

Nice to haves:
    real workflow - but it's more general to highlight the benefits of the proposed approaches.

Notes:
    In the BG section, introduce the edge computing paradigms
        But shift the focus towards the computing continuum to capture the possibility to leverage infrastructure resources in different places.

Should I change streaming to unary calls? - is there actually a perf benefit to doing it.
    It's simpler to translate those to REST API calls.

Add configuration controlling the experimental settings.

Figure out what I want to measure exactly.


In the background section, identify that my work is useful regardless of how a workflow is composed. It refers to the low level aspects. the way the interaces are designed, they are not dependendent on the structure of the workflow.



No special instrumentation - maybe just log lines and save them externally
    Process them with pandas and visualize with the graphing stuff on python.

What log lines do I need to gather? How to grab the logs of
