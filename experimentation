        Step 1 & 2 can be on both the edge and cloud zones. -- to highlight the fallback function
        Step 3 & 4 are cloud only -- to make the computation move to the cloud.
    
    4 nodes - 2 in the cloud, 2 in the edge zone.
        Through their labels, and schedule pods using affinity / taints
