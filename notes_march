1. Split up the solution file into multiple, smaller ones.
    To easier work with them.


2. Diagrams, etc. explain the solution in a lot of detail.
    Explain with a diagram where the routing decision happens and what are the parameters that influence that decision.
        Explain/.
5. Run and document the Experiments
    Collect them from everywhere
7. Example workflow: both data intensive and control flow intensive.
8. Data locality that actually works


3. Need to add references to all chapters
4. Fill in the background chapter
    -> Need to figure out the final sections - what will I go into? Perhaps edge taxonomy would be an interesting aspect to get into.
    -> Communication protocols in between microservices
    -> Data locality.
    -> Related works study, in relation with support for data locality, shared containers, edge support
        -> Might need to add more:
            Data locality in the cloud is one thing, data locality in the edge is an entirely different hting and treating the edge/ cloud as a computing continuum instead of 

6. Update the intro section



7. What's left in the implementation part:
    Thread safety.
        in the control plane components    
    Keeping track of busy steps.
        Gathering data about the current load on a node.
        Might need to add some stuf
        f in the design and implemnetation section (if I implement it as a DaeomonSet)
    Data locality
    Request queueing
    Workflow specification language.
    Gathering the data I need
