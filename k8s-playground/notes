Need to create the Storage Adapter DaemonSet
Need to create the orchestrator-service service
Need to define the pod with 2 containers in it: the sidecar and the compute step

Expose the necessary ports:
    NodePort

Implementation: 
    -> Data storage master node 
        -> Slaves that can coordinate to share the data
    -> A way of specifying a workflow?

Experiments:
    Hard linking the data instead of copying it across locations on the same machine.
    Data locality 
        -> non-hot partitions
        -> Bandwidth used
        -> 


Thesis stuff:
    Go into some details why hardlinking works but not symbolic linking

    Design and implemnentation aspects need to be discussed
