Number plate recognition software.
    - Only detect electric vehicles.
    Predict the load on the electrical grid in an area.

    Dynamic load per area
    Data volume is high - number plate recognition. 
    High filtering ratio.

    Not really latency sensitive though..

    How to do joins between different data sets?
        In the compute step, pull other data in.

    Merge multiple events into a single one. -- to do aggregation. How exactly?
