Add a string representation to the Any field (serialized as string) - done
  -> The data platform 
Workflow serialization - 
API to register the workflow 
Keeping track of busy steps:  
  -> In the orchestrator. Measure load by the number of concurrent requests this step instance can handle.

Multithreaded steps.

Nice to have:
  Need to add some parameters for the compute step.


It's not about the algorithm and how complex it is, but rather measuring the effect it can have.
For the implementation drawbacks, the data adapter being wasteful if not used (idle)
The work done here is applicable irrespsective of the expresiveness of the workflow.
